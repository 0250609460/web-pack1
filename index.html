<h1>A brief history of programming languages</h1>
<h2>5 generations of programming languages</h2>
<p>1</p>
<ul>
    <li>First generation: Programming languages had machine language (languages zero and one).</li> 
    <li>Second generation: languages were more understandable to humans (such as assembly language).</li>
    <li>Third generation: They need a compiler and its commands are understandable to humans, like the .(COBOL language)</li>
    <li>Fourth generation: They have colloquial languages, such as Oracle and SQL.</li>
    <li>Fifth generation: They can be understood by the algorithms that the programmer writes. Like prolog and Visual basic</li>
</ul>

<h4><em>What are the world's first programming languages?</em></h4>
<ol>
    <li>According to the first principle, which is called Shared-program technique.</li>
    <li>The second principle is conditional control transfer.</li>
</ol>
article 1:Hardware should be simple, and by combining these simple commands, a complex software command should be created.
<br>
article 2:According to this principle, a computer program can have several blocks called subroutines.
